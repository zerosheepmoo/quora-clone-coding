# Quora Clone Coding

This project was based on cloning coding via [리액트 깎는 노인's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3-4QTcAcNk&t=9s),
which seems to be inspired by [Code with Akky's video](https://youtu.be/13_o9NZPV1o).

I just modifed few things such as using nullish operator instead of ternary operator, using rafce, and etc.
I used the vscode editor, while the Intellij was used in the video.

## Overview

- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.
- This app is being hosted by firebase.
- only google sign in, default sign up/in, signout(via clicking avatar image), post and reply functionality are implemnted. The others are just UI.
- In personal, this project is not proper for react beginner and who wants to get used to write a variety of react hooks. Might be appropriate for Redux newbie.

## Scripts

- `yarn start`: dev mode
- `yarn build`: production build

## To run this app

- `git clone`(or just download) and move to the project root path on the terminal.
- run `yarn`
- After installation finishes, run `yarn start` and check `localhost:3000`
